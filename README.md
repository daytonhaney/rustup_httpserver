# rustup_httpserver
HTTP Server From Scratch In Rust


In Rust, Modules or  mod  are the same as folders. In this project, you can see that we break up the main.rs 

to make the code mroe readable...or does it as a lot of mod folders are also difficult to track. 

This project is for Learning Purposes Only via -

Udemy - " Fundamentals of the Rust Programming Language "   - Lyubomir Gavadinov 

Right Now - This code starts the server and that is all..it is a work in progress..It is not my code, but I'm learning !
